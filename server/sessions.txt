req.session.userId = user.id;

storing data into session (redis)

{
  sess:asdfqewfasdf -> {userId: 1}
}

express-session will set a cookie on my browser asdfaewqf 
(signed version of the `sess` key)

when user makes a request, the browser value will be sent to server.

on the server, it unsigns the value, checks it matches the `sess` value

make a request to redis, and get the data that matches the data.

store that on req.session.
